## What is a Data Type? 
Data Type defines the nature of the data, such as whether it is an integer, a floating-point number, a string, a boolean, or something more complex like a list or object.In JavaScript, datatypes are used to define the kind of value a variable can hold.
 JavaScript has a flexible type system and supports both primitive and non-primitive (reference) datatypes.


## 1. Javascript Types.
What are the different types that we have in javascript.

1. Numbers
2. Boolean
3. String
4. Undefined
5. Null - its type is Object(mistake)
6. Symbol("Abhinish") - new In ES6
7. {} Object

Where are function and array.

Javascript has a operator called `typeof` that tells the type of item.

Undefine is the absence of the defination , its  default value when javascript initializes our variable. eg function return undefine without having any return keyword.
