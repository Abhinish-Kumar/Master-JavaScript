# HTML Drag and Drop API

## Drag Events

HTML drag-and-drop uses the `DOM event model` and `drag events ` inherited from mouse events.

A typical drag operation begins when a user selects a draggable element, continues when the user drags the element to a droppable element, and then ends when the user releases the dragged element.
