After this, Microsoft introduced its own web browser in 1995, which was named Internet Explorer. Now due to two web-browsers in the market, the browser war between Netscape Navigator and Internet Explorer has started. Microsoft created a new language for its Internet Explorer called JScript by reverse engineering. JScript was first released in 1996, which supported CSS. The biggest problem with this was that the web developer had to connect with more users, for which he had to work separately for both browsers. Later, Internet Explorer covered 95% of the market at the cost of its brand.

For so many browsers, the web developer had to write code that would support all browsers. This work took a lot of time and was also a bit confusing. To solve this problem, a conference was held in 2008 and an agreement was reached with all browser companies that all would use the same standard language for their browsers. Script 5 was then standardized in December 2009, which was supported in all browsers. The biggest update for JavaScript was ECMAScript 6, which added a lot of new features in it like let const  arrow function etc.
