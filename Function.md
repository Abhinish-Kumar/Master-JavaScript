Javascript allow us to write a block of code once and read it every time whenever we need it. Reusable block of code is called a function. Write a block of code give it a name and you can use this whole block of code by calling its name only. 
We are reducing the line of codes , and we are using the same code again and again. If we have  a bug , then we only need to change at single place in our function.
In javascript we have functions without name also. The purpose of the name is that somebody can call us by that name . If we call the function with its name then function will say that heyy i am here with this lines of code , come and execute these lines of code.
